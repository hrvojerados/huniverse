          Hi my name is Hrvoje Rado≈° and this
          is my website/blog. I plan to use this 
          website primarily to share the projects 
          on which I have worked on or on which I'm 
          working on. But I also want people 
          to get to know me through my own space on 
          the Internet. As you can probably guess now 
          I'm not really a fan of social media.
          I plan to post a wide variety of posts here
          (hence the "universe" in the name) and I 
          hope you'll enjoy reading them.

        </p> 
        <Link to="/posts">
          Click here to view my blog posts         
        </Link>
        <button onClick={() => setShow((prev) => !prev)}>
            hide
        </button>
      </div>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
